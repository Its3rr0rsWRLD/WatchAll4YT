### WatchAll4YT Extension Policy

#### Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: February 25, 2025**

**1. Introduction**  
WatchAll4YT ("the Extension") is a browser tool designed to enhance your YouTube experience by adding a "Watch All Videos" button to channel pages, allowing you to quickly access a playlist of all videos uploaded by a channel. We value your privacy and are committed to transparency about how the Extension handles data. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed, how it’s used, and your rights.

**2. Information Processed**  
- **YouTube URL and Page Data:** When you click the "Watch All Videos" button, the Extension processes:  
  - The current URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC...` or `https://www.youtube.com/@handle`) to extract the channel ID.  
  - If the channel ID isn’t in the URL, the Extension fetches and scans the page’s HTML source for a channel ID (e.g., `"channelId":"UC..."`).  
- **No Personal Data Collection:** The Extension does not collect or store personal information such as your name, email, IP address, or browsing history. All processing occurs locally on your device.  
- **Usage Context:** The Extension monitors URL changes on YouTube to dynamically add the button but does not log or transmit this activity.

**3. How We Use Information**  
- The Extension processes channel IDs solely to generate a playlist URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UU...`) and open it in a new tab.  
- No data is sent to external servers controlled by the Extension’s developer. All operations are performed locally within your browser.

**4. Third-Party Services**  
- The Extension interacts with YouTube, owned by Google. Any data shared with YouTube (e.g., visiting a playlist URL) is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
- The Extension does not rely on additional third-party APIs or services beyond YouTube itself.

**5. Data Storage and Security**  
- **Local Processing:** All data processing (e.g., extracting channel IDs, generating playlist URLs) happens on your device in real-time and is not stored by the Extension after use.  
- **No Centralized Storage:** The Extension does not upload or store data on remote servers.  
- **Security:** As an open-source tool, the Extension’s code is publicly auditable. Its security depends on your browser and device environment.

**6. Your Rights**  
- Since no personal data is collected or stored by the Extension, there are no specific data access or deletion requests to process. You control the Extension’s behavior by choosing when to use it.

**7. Contact Us**  
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please file an issue on the Extension’s GitHub repository (https://github.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/WatchAll4YT) or contact the developer through available channels.
